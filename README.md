# Sakif Chowdhury's Personal Website

Hey, I'm Sakif, a 20 year-old student in my first year at York University currently studying IT. I was born and raised in Toronto and graduated from Northern Secondary School.

My roots trace back to Bangladesh from my parents, and I take a lot of pride in my culture and faith as a Muslim. Iâ€™m passionate about tech and always looking to learn and keep up with the latest trends in the industry. Whether itâ€™s diving into code or picking up the basics, I know Iâ€™ve found my passion.

### About Me

Iâ€™m curious about how tech can solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m into web development and system analysis. Outside of academics, I train in kickboxing and enjoy playing soccer for fun.
